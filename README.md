# Course Description
This course will focus on understanding various concepts that can be utilized in order to create software applications that are more secure. 
Students will learn how to identify common programming errors that can lead to software vulnerabilities for an organization. 
Students will be able to identify the risks and consequences associated with poor programming constructs. 
They will also apply the principles of strong software design and development to the Java and C++ programming languages.

# Module 1 Critical Thinking Requirements
- [x] Part I
   - Create a simple C++ console application using Eclipse IDE that prints the following information for a fictional person:
      - First Name, Last Name, Street Address, City, Zip code.
- [x] Part II
   - Given the provided code in file CSC450_CT1_mod1-1.cpp, correct all syntax errors so that the code will compile correctly.
- [x] Part III
   - Given the provided code in file CSC450_CT1_mod1-2.cpp, correct all syntax errors so that the code will compile correctly.
                
# Module 2 Critical Thinking Requirements
- [ ] Create a simple C++ console application that does the following:
   - Take two string inputs from a user.
   - Concatenate the two strings and then print the resulting output to the screen.
   - Take the two string inputs from the user 3 times for varying string lengths.
     
# Module 3 Critical Thinking Requirements
- [ ] Create a C++ program that does the following: 
   - Asks the user to enter three integer values as input. 
   - Store the values into three different variables. 
   - For each variable, create an integer pointer to dynamic memory. 
   - Display the contents of the variables and pointers. 
   - In your program, be sure to use the new operator and delete operators to management memory.

# Module 5 Critical Thinking Requirements
- [ ] Create a C++ program that does the following: 
   - Obtain input from a user.
   - Append and store the input to the provided CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt file without deleting the existing data:
   - Create a reversal method that will reverse all of the characters in the CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt file.
   - Store the result of the reversal method in a CSC450-mod5-reverse.txt file.

# Module 7 Portfolio Project Reuirements
- [ ] Part I
   - Create a C++ application that will exhibit concurrency concepts:
      - Create two threads that will act as counters:
         - One thread should count up to 20.
         - Once thread one reaches 20, then a second thread should be used to count down to 0.
- [ ] Part II
   - Provide a detailed analysis of appropriate concepts that could impact your application:
      - Specifically Address:
         - Performance issues with concurrency.
         - Vulnerabilities exhibited with use of strings.
         - Security of the data types exhibited.

# Module 8 Portfolio Project Requirements
- [ ] Part I
   - Create a Java application that will exhibit concurrency concepts:
      -  Create two threads that will act as counters:
         - One thread should count up to 20.
         - Once thread one reaches 20, then a second thread should be used to count down to 0.
- [ ] Part II
   - Provide a detailed analysis of appropriate concepts that could impact your application:
      - Specifically Address:
         - Performance issues with concurrency.
         - Vulnerabilities exhibited with use of strings.
         - Security of the data types exhibited.
