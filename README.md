   - Create a simple C++ console application using Eclipse IDE that prints the following information for a fictional person:
      - First Name, Last Name, Street Address, City, Zip code.
- [x] Part II
   - Given the provided code in file CSC450_CT1_mod1-1.cpp, correct all syntax errors so that the code will compile correctly.
- [x] Part III
   - Given the provided code in file CSC450_CT1_mod1-2.cpp, correct all syntax errors so that the code will compile correctly.
                
# Module 2 Critical Thinking Requirements
- [ ] Create a simple C++ console application that does the following:
   - take two string inputs from a user.
   - concatenate the two strings and then print the resulting output to the screen.
   - Take the two string inputs from the user 3 times for varying string lengths.
     
# Module 3 Critical Thinking Requirements
- [ ] Create a C++ program that does the following: 
   - asks the user to enter three integer values as input. 
   - Store the values into three different variables. 
   - For each variable, create an integer pointer to dynamic memory. 
   - Display the contents of the variables and pointers. 
   - In your program, be sure to use the new operator and delete operators to management memory.
